MEMORY CARD GAME

Project Description

My app is called Movie Memory game. It's a game app for players who want to test their memory skills. A player can join an online game and play a round, with the score being kept automatically and game results displayed at then end of a round -- however many successful matches the players gets within the alloted time. Users will have the option to play again. The round will begin with a set time to memorize as many of the cards as possible and then the player will have a selection cycle where they choose two cards in hopes of getting it correct. After two have been selected, they both turn back over.
